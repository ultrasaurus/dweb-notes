## Peer to Peer databases

Technologies
- Scuttlebutt
- HyperCore
- DAT
- IPFS

Applications
- UNSDG — sustainable development goals, interim for indexing, for ML
- Mapeo - amazon rain forest 
- Substack - peer map

## Interoperability 


- Versions
- Operations / events
- Data types

Things to think about using
- CRDT — converge to one state
- Inmutable chain of diffs


———

Challenges of interoperability?
Next steps to make that happen

Single ontology doesn’t work
Must be Federated
Structure local to the dataset
GraphQL — presentation later querying

IPLD — Linked data, schemes negotiation 

Authority : DNS, public key

Versions

Time/version — every
Talking about causality not time

Lamport clock to create local ordering

Application independent of database

Data-types and subscription


## Scalability - 
- number of participants
- Number of things
- History - length of history 

Log size, limited window (time, number, size) - snapshot
Inportance of trust, lineage, auditibilty
Contextualized trust
